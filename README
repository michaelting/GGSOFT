# GGSOFT: Golden Gate DNA Assembly Size-specified Overhang Finding Tool #
#=======================================================================#

#=======#
# Usage #
#=======#

GGSOFT is intended for use in finding DNA overhangs to be used in 
Golden Gate DNA Assembly methods, which utilize Type IIs restriction
enzyme digestion. Type IIs restriction enzymes cut remotely from their
recognition site without regards to the cutting sequence. The length of
overhangs produced through RE digestion varies from enzyme to enzyme.

GGSOFT explores overhang combinations for use in Golden Gate DNA
Assembly that maximizes the distance between all overhang pairs in an
attempt to prevent multiple overhangs from annealing in positions other
than intended. For purposes such as a one-pot reaction, too similar
overhangs can result in Golden Gate DNA fragments annealing together
in the wrong positions relative to one another.

#=================#
# Version History #
#=================#

* v1.1 - Added topxcombos.py, allowing for retrieval of the top x percent
	 of scored overhang combinations. Minor modifications to ggsoft.py
	 in process() and main(), swapping optparse out for argparse. 
	 Overhang scoring includes an exponential ID extension penalty for
	 overhang pairs. Overhang combinations containing palindromic
	 overhangs (e.g. 'GATC') are excluded.

* v1.0 - Initial version of GGSOFT. Future work includes reducing computation 
	 time of construction of the scoring table and implementation of 
	 a heuristic to reduce memory usage during computation of overhang 
	 combinations.

#=============#
# Future Work #
#=============#

 - More specific handling of palindromic overhangs (homodimerization). Current
   handling of palindromic overhangs results in combinations with those
   overhangs being excluded completely from final results.
 - Speed up scoring table construction
 - Integrate topxcombos functionality into optional arguments for ggsoft.py
 - Primer generation functionality in addition to overhang finding? 
 - Use heuristics to speed up finding overhang window region combinations
 - Use information from homology to optimize overhang locations across
   a family of related sequences
	 
#============#
# Algorithms #
#============#

Given a user input of overhang size, determine optimal DNA overhang sequences using
a scoring function to maximize pairwise distances between all pairwise combinations
of overhangs, 4**n, where n is the length of the overhang.

Given an overhang size of 4, there are 4**4 = 256 possible unique overhangs.
Given an overhang size of 5, there are 4**5 = 1024 possible unique overhangs.

A scoring table is precalculated given the overhang length, which is used to 
accelerate the scoring calculation by storing pairwise overhand scores in memory.

For an overhang of size 4, a size 256*256 table is calculated.
For an overhang of size 5, a size 1024*1024 table is calculated.

Note that for overhangs of length greater than 4bp, computation time of the scoring
table becomes exponentially large. Computation time also increases with decreasing
fragment size (more fragments, more overhang combinations).

#================#
# Files Included #
#================#

* ggsoft.py 	- runs the GGSOFT program given an input sequence, output file name,
	      	  overhang size, minimum fragment length, and maximum fragment length

* ggsofttest.py - nose testing framework for ggsoft.py

* topxcombos.py	- retrieves the top X percent of scored overhang combinations
		  specified by user input

==============================
===== Output from GGSOFT =====
==============================
Output from ggsoft.py is written as such:

((202, 412, 617), (36, [TTCG, GGTA, CCAC]))
((202, 412, 622), (36, [TTCG, GGTA, CAAT]))
...
((204, 414, 622), (8, [CGGT, TAAC, CAAT]))

The sequence in the left half of the pair, (202, 412, 617), indicates the indices where
overhangs begin in the template sequence. 

**********************************************************************************
NOTE: In the output data, The template sequence is 0-INDEXED, while many other DNA
      software programs use 1-INDEXED notation.
**********************************************************************************

The right half, (36, [TTCG, GGTA, CCAC]), indicates that the overall score of the 
overhang combination is 36, and the overhangs resulting from the listed indices 
are [TTCG, GGTA, CCAC], meaning we have TTCG starting at index 202, GGTA starting 
at index 412, and CCAC starting at index 617 in our template sequence.

====================================
===== Output from Top X Combos =====
====================================
Output from topxcombos.py is written as such:

Top 17 percent of combinations from ./tests/testggsoft_P42212.txt
261 of 1540 combinations selected
((202, 412, 617), (36, [TTCG, GGTA, CCAC]))
((202, 412, 622), (36, [TTCG, GGTA, CAAT]))
...
((194, 404, 610), (34, [TCAC, AAGA, TACT]))

topxcombos.py extracts the top x percent of lines from a ggsoft output file.
