GGSOFT: Golden Gate DNA Assembly Size-specified Overhang Finding Tool

Given a user input of overhang size, determine optimal DNA overhang sequences using
a scoring function to maximize pairwise distances between all pairwise combinations
of overhangs, 4**n, where n is the length of the overhang.

Given an overhang size of 4, there are 4**4 = 256 possible unique overhangs.
Given an overhang size of 5, there are 4**5 = 1024 possible unique overhangs.

A scoring table is precalculated given the overhang length, which is used to 
accelerate the scoring calculation by storing pairwise overhand scores in memory.

For an overhang of size 4, a size 256*256 table is calculated.
For an overhang of size 5, a size 1024*1024 table is calculated.

Note that for overhangs of length greater than 4bp, computation time of the scoring
table becomes exponentially large. Computation time also increases with decreasing
fragment size.

Files included:

* ggsoft.py 	- runs the GGSOFT program given an input sequence, output file name,
	      	  overhang size, minimum fragment length, and maximum fragment length

* ggsofttest.py - nose testing framework for ggsoft.py

* topxcombos.py	- retrieves the top X percent of scored overhang combinations
		  specified by user input

Future work:
 - Speed up scoring table construction
 - Use heuristics to speed up finding overhang window region combinations
 - Use information from homology to optimize overhang locations across
   a family of related sequences

Version History:

* v1.1 - Added topxcombos.py, allowing for retrieval of the top x percent of scored
	 overhang combinations.

* v1.0 - Initial version of GGSOFT. Future work includes reducing computation time of
	 construction of the scoring table and implementation of a heuristic to reduce
	 memory usage during computation of overhang combinations.
